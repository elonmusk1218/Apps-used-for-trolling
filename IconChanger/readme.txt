1. What is IconChanger
-----------------------
  IconChanger allows you to customize icons for separate files.
  By default, Windows displays the same icon for all files
  that have the same file name extension.
  Using IconChanger, you can assign an individual icon almost to
  any file. Also, program can change the icon of a folder
  or shortcut. It is possible to change the icon of all file type,
  i.e. for all files with the given extension. You can drag favorite 
  icons to a list and have easy access to them later. You can change 
  the system icons (Windows uses them to display main items 
  on the Start menu and other miscellaneous objects). 

  The evaluation version of IconChanger can change no more than 3 icons
  and is limited to finding a maximum of 3000 icons, however,
  with the registered version of this software you can change 
  and find an unlimited number of icons.

  Also, you can use IconChanger:
    - to search for icons inside files on your computer,
    - to show the file with the icon that displays the given object now,
    - to view icons embedded in a file
    - to save an icon as .ico file and copy an icon image to the clipboard.

  TO LAUNCH IconChanger, right click on an object whose icon you want
  to change, and from the context menu choose Change Icon…
